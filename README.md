Don't be sad! Your microwaved frozen burrito lunch is fine! Don't be intimidated
by your friends posting their artisan homebaked sourdough baguettes. They're
eating peanut butter every other meal too.

They're just not taking photos of those humble meals.

It is time to take photos of the humble meals!
